// TODO: add feature of removing values from the transient store.
// TODO: rename transient store to global store. Add feature of declaring different store objects
// (maps, sets, lists etc.) for each tag. Together with embedded tag logics aspects (like global store, bean container,
// scoped attribute cache etc.) these store objects will form tag logics context. Also this would be convenient to
// re-design action helper interface to give the helpers access to the context through the "call" method - this will
// solve problem of re-binding arguments and the problem of concurrent access to XMLProcessor.
// Also this solves problem of code generation approach.
// TODO: add features to interact with an interface similar to the container factory's provided by an existing
// container to be able to dynamically add/modify/delete bean definitions.
// TODO: add a feature to call not only methods on container-managed beans, but also fields and properties.
