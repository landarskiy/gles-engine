// TODO: add possibility to remove single beans as well as bean groups from singleton cache.
// TODO: add possibility to obtain bean member management (method, property calls etc.) from a container through
// special interfaces. This will ease IoC usage in XML scenarios for example, as well as enable to hide generated code and/or optimizations.
// TODO: add aspect-like-oriented events to container. For example, to inject fresh OpenGL context to all necessary beans.
